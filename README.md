# My Learning Progress

This repo is for tracking personal projects, coursework, and readings.

### My goals for 2019: 

I'm hoping to upskill a lot this year through self-learning. My biggest hurdle will be sticking to a study routine outside of work and working hard while managing fatigue. I'll be tracking time in a spreadsheet so I can do an audit at the end of the year.

- **Time investment:** 
    - Log 440 study and project hours in data science and SWE from February to December
- **To ship:**
    - Make 10 Medium posts (~100 hours)
    - Build 2 products (~80 hours)
        - Build a consumer product with Python, host with flask (~40 hrs)
    - Build 5 side projects (~100 hours)
- **To learn:**
    - Learn Python for both data analysis and SWE (>100 hrs)
    - Learn natural language processing (>60 hours)
    - Learn basic time series analysis (>30 hours)
