# My Learning Progress

This repo is for tracking personal projects, coursework, and readings.

My current learning interests: production machine learning applications (data science), software engineering in Python (data structures and algorithms), and natural language processing (specialization).

### Personal goals for 2019: 

Hoping to grow a lot this year in my data skills. My biggest hurdles will be maintaining a study routine alongside full-time work and managing fatigue. 

I'm tracking time in a spreadsheet to do an audit at the end of the year.

- **Time investment:** 
    - Log 500 study and project hours in data science and SWE from February to December
- **To ship:**
    - Publish 20 Medium posts
    - Build 2 products (~80 hours)
        1. Build a consumer product with Python, host with Flask (~40 hrs)
    - Build 5 side projects (~100 hours)
- **To learn:**
    - Learn Python for SWE (>100 hrs)
        - 100 LeetCode questions
        - Think Python
        - Hitchhiker's Guide to Python
        - Effective Python
    - Learn natural language processing (>60 hours)
    - Learn basic time series analysis (>30 hours)
    
### Time spent:
- February: 4h23m
- March: 16h6m
- April: 10h52m
- May: goal is 40 hours
