These are all the resources and projects I'm working on and have completed to teach myself data science.

Some inspiration (stolen from [Robert Chang](https://github.com/robert8138/deep-learning-deliberate-practice)):

> Every Saturday, you will have a choice between staying at home and reading research papers/implementing algorithms, vs. watching TV. If you spend all Saturday working, there probably won't be any short-term reward, and your current boss won't even know or say "nice work." Also, after that Saturday of hard work, you're not actually that much better at machine learning. But here's the secret: If you do this not just for one weekend, but instead study consistently for a year, then you will become very good. -Andrew Ng
