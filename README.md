# My 2020 learning journey

I'm currently interested in inferential statistics, generalized linear models, and causal inference.

Information that I'm consuming to that end: _Statistical Inference_ (Casella and Berger), _An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models_ (Dobson), and _The Causal Inference Book_ (Hernan and Robins). [This book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) will be my reference for interpretable machine learning.

I also want to strenghten my SQL and data visualization skills since these are key skills for data analysts. To that end, I'll be working through SQLZoo.net, _The Business Intelligence Analyst Course 2019_, and _Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau_.

### What I'm working on now

- **Literature** 
    - Various papers on Marketing Mix Modeling

### Measurable goals for 2020

This year, I want to focus on deepening my knowledge in applied statistics, becoming a data scientist more generally, and being a better citizen in my local and global community. To that end, here are my goals for 2020. 

- [ ] Publish 24 good blog posts
- [ ] Read 10 technical books
- [ ] Publish 6 GitHub projects
- [ ] Read 24 books
- [ ] Build personal website for blogging
- [ ] Learn Chinese at high-school reading/speaking proficiency

With respect to the data science field, I want to push towards a decision scientist role. In other words, on the [data science spectrum](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-the-data-science-spectrum-to-find-the-right-data-science-career-path-for-you-eff98b6c589c) with statistics on one end and computer science on the other, I want to veer more heavily towards the statistics. Once I feel comfortable with my expertise, I'll pick up more on the software engineering and deep learning end. This [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/2020-is-coming-practical-tips-for-landing-your-first-data-job-13f77aab1333) is also pretty good. And [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/new-years-resolutions-for-data-scientists-43a0d3d8b4ff) are some resolutions from another practitioner. [Last resource](https://towardsdatascience.com/which-flavor-of-data-professional-are-you-5e01375584ce).

I hope that by the end of 2020, I accomplish 80% of these goals. To bake these goals into my lifestyle, I'm planning on having **daily process goals** of learning something new for 30 minutes, writing for 30 minutes, and reading for 30 minutes each day.

### Achievements

To have a record of personal milestones, I'm tracking my learning progress here.

Got my first data science job as a Senior Data Analyst on January 6th. This job has been the result of several years of perseverance and persistence, and is only the beginning of a career in data science.
