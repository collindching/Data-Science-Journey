# My 2020 learning journey

I'm currently interested in inferential statistics, generalized linear models, and causal inference.

Information that I'm consuming to that end: _Statistical Inference_ (Casella and Berger), _An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models_ (Dobson), and _The Causal Inference Book_ (Hernan and Robins).

I also want to strenghten my SQL and data visualization skills significantly. These are key skills for data analysts. To that end, I'll be working through SQLZoo.net, _The Business Intelligence Analyst Course 2019_, and _Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau_.

Lastly, because it's basically a biblical text in the data science and ML community, I'll also be working through _Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow_.

### Measurable goals for 2020

This year, I want to focus on deepening my knowledge in applied statistics, becoming a data scientist more generally, and being a better citizen in my local and global community. To that end, here are my goals for 2020. 

- [ ] Publish 50 blog posts
- [ ] Publish 6 GitHub projects
- [ ] Read 24 books
- [ ] Complete 4 online courses
- [ ] Learn Chinese at a high-school reading and speaking level
- [ ] Build a personal blog & portfolio website

I hope that by the end of 2020, I can accomplish nearly all (80%) of theese goals. To bake these goals into my lifestyle, I'm planning on having **daily process goals** of learning something new for 30 minutes, writing for 30 minutes, and reading for 30 miutes each day.
