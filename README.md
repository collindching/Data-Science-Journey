# My 2020 learning journey

### What I'm working on

Covering multilevel modeling theory and developing Python data science skills in more depth.

- [_Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models_](https://faculty.psau.edu.sa/filedownload/doc-12-pdf-a1997d0d31f84d13c1cdc44ac39a8f2c-original.pdf)

- [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf)

### What I want to work on

Interested in learning more about data collection methods, data engineering, and putting models into production.

## My 2020 goals

This year, I want to focus on deepening my knowledge in applied statistics, becoming a data scientist more generally, and being a better citizen in my local and global community. To that end, here are my goals for 2020. 

- [ ] Publish 24 good blog posts
- [ ] Read 10 technical books
- [ ] Publish 6 GitHub projects
- [ ] Read 24 books
- [ ] Learn Chinese at high-school reading/speaking proficiency
- [x] [Build personal website for blogging](https://collinching.com)


I hope that by the end of 2020, I accomplish 80% of these goals. To bake these goals into my lifestyle, I'm planning to learn/study for 40 minutes daily and write to process for 20 minutes daily.
