# My 2020 learning journey

Learning components of data science
- Statistics
- Modeling
- Software engineering
- Business domains

### What I'm working on

1. [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf)
2. [_Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models_](https://faculty.psau.edu.sa/filedownload/doc-12-pdf-a1997d0d31f84d13c1cdc44ac39a8f2c-original.pdf)
3. [_Doing Bayesian Data Analysis_](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/algo-list/statistics/data-mining/John_K_Kruschke-Doing_Bayesian_Data_Analysis-EN.pdf)
4. [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/?fbclid=IwAR2oSExw3Luz7jLSE0eIWguTBe3pHOqpbBL0i9eYKBxcFenwq4LWm484xg0)


### What I want to work on

I'm currently interested in regression analysis (linear regression, and glms) and inferential statistics. Books I plan to read to that end:

- [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf)
- [_Statistical Inference_](https://fsalamri.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/casella_berger_statistical_inference1.pdf)
- [_Mostly Harmless Econometrics_](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/203124/mod_resource/content/1/Angrist%20%20Pischke.pdf)
- [_Econometric Analysis_](https://spu.fem.uniag.sk/cvicenia/ksov/obtulovic/Mana%C5%BE.%20%C5%A1tatistika%20a%20ekonometria/EconometricsGREENE.pdf)
- [_An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models_](https://reneues.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/an-introduction-to-generalized-linear-models-second-edition-dobson.pdf)
- [_Interpretable ML Book_](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) 

Later, I hope to invest more time into causal inference. I also want to invest more on my SQL and data viz skills.

## My 2020 goals

This year, I want to focus on deepening my knowledge in applied statistics, becoming a data scientist more generally, and being a better citizen in my local and global community. To that end, here are my goals for 2020. 

- [ ] Publish 24 good blog posts
- [ ] Read 10 technical books
- [ ] Publish 6 GitHub projects
- [ ] Read 24 books
- [x] [Build personal website for blogging](https://collinching.com)
- [ ] Learn Chinese at high-school reading/speaking proficiency

I hope that by the end of 2020, I accomplish 80% of these goals. To bake these goals into my lifestyle, I'm planning to learn/study for 40 minutes daily and write to process for 20 minutes daily.

### Links on learning
Useful links to review for learning advice. Saw this [blog](https://reasoniamhere.com/2015/09/24/how-to-learn-a-foreign-language-from-the-comfort-of-your-home-dont-feel-bad-dont-get-bored-dont-give-up/) about learning languages - thought the advice was great.
